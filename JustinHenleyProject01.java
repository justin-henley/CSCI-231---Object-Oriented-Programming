/* Program Output
    Question 6:
        "Hello, World!
        This is my first Java Program."

    Question 7:
        Build failed; "java: package system does not exist"

    Question 8:
        It seems to have no effect because of the automatic formatting of IntelliJ.
        IntelliJ automatically concatenates the two sentence fragments, shown below:
        "System.out.println("Hello, " +
                "World!");"

    Question 9:
        The lack of a line break causes the next print to proceed on the same line:
        "Hello, World!This is my first Java Program.
